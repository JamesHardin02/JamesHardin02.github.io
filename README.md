My GitHub account contains repositories of personal projects which I have worked on.

This repository is for assignments given to me through Wake Tech Community College which are for the class CTI-110.0003

I used the GitHub Desktop application's GUI to find this repository which I created on GitHub.com and I selected the option to clone it into the directory of my choice.
